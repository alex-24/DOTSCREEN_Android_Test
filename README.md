<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was made as part of an Android Technical test.

The app is a timed Tic Tac Toes game between two human players using the same device.
Until time runs out they can play as many sets as they want. At the end a popup displays the overall game result.
